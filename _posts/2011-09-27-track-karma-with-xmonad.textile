p(meta). Track your Reddit Karma with Xmonad and Xmobar

I was inspired by "this":http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/j71pb/track_karma_with_conky/ post from reddit so I made a little bash bash script to pull karma data from the about.json file that reddit provides for each user. 
So here is the little bash script, it uses curl to download your users about.json, which contains all kinds of data about your reddit user, but we are only interested in a couple things. I'll talk about each part of the script briefly.

<pre><code>#! /bin/bash
if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
    echo Usage: $(basename $0) username 
    exit 1
fi

curl --connect-timeout 1 -fsm 3 http://www.reddit.com/user/$1/about.json |
awk '{match($0, "k_karma\": ([0-9]+)", a); match($0, "t_karma\": ([0-9]+)", b); print "Link karma:", a[1], "Comment karma:", b[1];}'</code></pre>

First, the script requires a username as the an argument, so we check to see if the
user supplied one, if not, we print some usage information.
