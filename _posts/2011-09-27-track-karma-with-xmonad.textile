p(meta). Track your Reddit Karma with Xmonad and Xmobar

I was inspired by "this":http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/j71pb/track_karma_with_conky/ post from reddit so I made a little bash bash script to pull karma data from the about.json file that reddit provides for each user. 

So here is the little bash script, it uses curl to download your users about.json, which contains all kinds of data about your reddit user, but we are only interested in a couple things. I'll talk about each part of the script briefly.

<pre><code>#! /bin/bash
if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
    echo Usage: $(basename $0) username 
    exit 1
fi

curl --connect-timeout 1 -fsm 3 http://www.reddit.com/user/$1/about.json |
awk '{match($0, "k_karma\": ([0-9]+)", a); match($0, "t_karma\": ([0-9]+)", b);
    print "L:", a[1], "C:", b[1];}'</code></pre>

First, the script requires a username as the an argument, so we check to see if the user supplied one, if not, we print some usage information.

Then we download the about.json file, and use "awk":http://www.gnu.org/s/gawk/ to match for "t_karma" and "k_karma" or "Comment_karma" and "Link_karma", the part of the json file which stores the values for your comment and link karma.

And finally, print the values we found for our karma using L: for link karma and C: for comment karma, because it takes up less space on my xmobar. You of course could put whatever you want here.

You'll want to save that script somewhere in your home directory, and call it something memorable, I named mine reddit.sh.

Then, in your .xmobarrc, add:

@code , Run Com "/path/to/script/reddit.sh" ["USERNAME"] "reddit" 9000@

to the "commands" section of the file, replacing USERNAME with your reddit username, and putting in the path to your script.

Finally, at the bottom of your .xmobarrc in the "template" section you'll want to add %reddit% where ever you want the widget to appear.

If all has gone well, you should see something like this:
